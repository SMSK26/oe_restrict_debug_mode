Restrict Debug Mode Access for Odoo 18
        =====================================
        
        This module provides a security enhancement to control access to Odoo's
        Developer Mode (Debug Mode) in the backend interface.
        
        Key Features:
        - Allows only users belonging to a specific security group to use Debug Mode.
        - Show visual overlay and "Access Denied" message.
        
        This helps in maintaining data integrity and preventing unintended
        modifications by non-technical users.
